title: React With Redux
---

Redux is a state management library. In React, we know that we can maintain state inside a class component. Now when we are working with a complex app with many pages, there will be different components rendered by React-Router. These components do not share a common state to exchange data. Redux can help us here to act as a common place to get or set state.

Redux also allows us to write reusable components. When using Redux, components do not have to be tightly coupled with their parent component. Instead they can be written and used in a more reusable way.
