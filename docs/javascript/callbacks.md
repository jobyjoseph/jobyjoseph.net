title: Callbacks
---

A function that receives another function as its argument is called **Higher Order Function**. The function that is passed to Higher Order Function is called **callback**.

We were using callbacks in lot of places without even knowing they were callbacks. Callbacks are used in Array.map(), \_.filter, Button onClick event handler and so on.

Callbacks help us to delay the execution of a function to a later point in time.
