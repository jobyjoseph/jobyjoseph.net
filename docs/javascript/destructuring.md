Destructuring syntax was introduced in ES6. It allows us to work more easily with Arrays and Objects.

## Destructuring with Objects

In order to explain destructuring with objects, first we need to have an object to play with.

```javascript
const car = {
  company: "Mercedes",
  model: "GLS",
  year: 2019
};
```

Our next job is to print the `model` and `year` from the `car` object.
