title: Locallly, Just a Procrastination
---

When I am going to write my first blog in this site, I am worried if I can write well. But I am planning to anyway write, so that I can express myself. I earn bread and butter by writing code. Being a software engineer, I practiced taking my work whereever I go. That made me the most absent minded person in this world. Day and night, on rest or travel, I might be thinking about something. Always living in a separate world that is not the actual. Now I am trying to train my brain to focus on present. Very tough, but going forward I hope.

I always wished for an entrepreneur life in childhood. Why? Because I want money for luxury. Then I want to be job provider than a job seeker. After 10 years into career and reaching 33 years old age, the thought process have changed in a big way. Having 2 lovely kids at home takes my attention. Life is now feeling a sense of fulfillment, which reduced my interest in luxury. I am happy and thankful for all those happened so far in my life.

But the entrepreneur lava sometimes popout. What to do? I always try to launch a software product in market which solves a problem. I have made some in past. Some where open source, while few where premium. All went decently well. Due to lack of focus, all faded.

Now my brain has come up with a new one, but not giving lot of restlessness as in earlier days. **Locallly** is yet another idea which I am trying to fulfill. I registered locallly.com domain on 4th July 2018. As it happened every time, a burst of idea and one more domain registered. I might have bought and registered around 20 domains in my lifetime. After 324 days, when I write this blog nothing has happened about locallly. It was a big **Procrastination**.

Can you tell me what the hell is **locallly**? As you might have guessed, it is something which has to work locally. It is a mobile app. I can find things or get help from locals. A good thing about the app is that the user does not have to register to use it. We dont want to collect and sell your data.

Imagine you are driving to an unknown place without GPS. You might stop somewhere and ask somebody about directions. right? Will you first introduce yourself and give all biodata to that total stranger before asking a question? No! And you totally trust that stranger about direction and move ahead. In the same way, in life there are areas where a group of strangers can help you without sharing any biodata. Let us analyze few cases.

- You are planning to visit Maasai Mara National Reserve in Kenya. You need to know if a particular brand medicine is available nearby. A google search might not help beyond a limit if it is too specific. So you took, locallly app and set the location to "Maasai Mara National Reserve". You can see that 24 people are nearby. You shoot your question to those 24 people. Out of that 10 or 1 guy responded with a photo also. Now you are happy.
- You are from Kerala and you know only malayalam. You are planning to visit Beijing to do a machinery purchase for your factory. You took locallly app and changed your location to "Beijing". You asked in malayalam, "Anyone here who know Malayalam, please respond". You recieved one response and thats it.
- You are sitting in your home sofa. Now your locallly location is your current location. You just sent a shout, asking how is Avengers: End game? A flow of reply will satisfy you.

In similar fashion, lot of things can be done by locallly according to me. So how far we have progressed? Nothing much. That is why I said most of the time was for procrastination.

This journey with blog will help me and you know how is a product development. I am sure that it will not be a right journey. But I am trying to make an experience out of it. Am I motivated enough to start and complete it? Dont know. In my life the only consistent thing is inconsistency.

So far a domain locallly.com has been purchased. That is the only progress. Hope I can come up with some progress before next week. Yes, I am planning to update my progress every week here through my blog. Take care.
